# Vue Hello

## Project Rundown

This is simple project created with the intention of learning and testing vue.js features.

I will mainly focus on the basic features like setting up vue in the editor, getting used to the syntax and logic.

The goal here is to create a small landing page while using vue where i would normally use vanilla js.
